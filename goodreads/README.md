## 2. Classification of Dataset

The dataset falls into several analysis categories:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Exploring the distribution of ratings, correlations, and summary statistics.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizing predictive modeling for ratings.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of rating distributions and trends.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating relationships among ratings and publication years.

## 3. Formulation of Research Questions

The following research questions were formulated to guide the analysis:

1. What is the distribution of average ratings across different authors?
2. What are the top 10 books with the highest ratings, and how do their ratings counts compare?
3. Is there a correlation between the year of original publication and the average rating?
4. What is the trend of ratings over the years for specific popular books?
5. How does the number of ratings received affect the average rating of a book?

## 4. Analysis Plan

### Distribution and Comparison
- **Hypothesis**: Certain authors or genres receive consistently higher ratings.
- **Method**: Use Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization.

### Top Rated Books Analysis
- **Hypothesis**: Higher ratings count correlates with higher average ratings.
- **Method**: Sort data to find the top-rated books and visualize with bar plots.

### Correlation Analysis
- **Hypothesis**: Older books likely have lower ratings due to evolving standards.
- **Method**: Compute correlation coefficients and visualize with heatmaps.

### Trend Analysis
- **Hypothesis**: Popular books show increasing ratings due to sustained interest.
- **Method**: Use time series analysis for trends in ratings.

### Ratings Impact Analysis
- **Hypothesis**: Increased ratings contribute positively to the average rating.
- **Method**: Perform regression analysis or use machine learning methods.

## 5. Data Preparation Guidelines

- Convert numeric fields to appropriate data types.
- Handle missing values by replacing them with zeros.
- Replace infinite ratings with maximum possible values for analysis.
- Create additional metrics where necessary for deeper insights.
